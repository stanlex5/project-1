# Project-1
The purpose of this project is to investigate the connection between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of suicides. The task will include gathering information on suicide rates and Coronavirus cases from different nations throughout the span of the pandemic. The information will then, at that point, be broken down utilizing measurable strategies and representation procedures to recognize any examples or patterns.

Social isolation, economic instability, and mental health issues are just a few of the potential factors that will be investigated as part of the project, and they could all play a role in any shifts in suicide rates that occur during the pandemic. Likewise, the venture will look to recognize any viable mediations or approaches that have been executed to moderate the adverse consequence of the pandemic on emotional wellness and suicide rates.

The ultimate objective of this project is to learn more about how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the number of suicides and to come up with possible solutions. Public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health may be affected by this project's findings.
